In November 2013 I had the opportunity to work with the Australian Science Media Centre (AusSMC) and produce a talk explaining numbers and statistics.  The deal was that it was 11 concepts on numbers and stats in 20 minutes.  The concepts being:

- General Number Hygiene
- Big and Little Numbers
- Surveys
- Averages
- Understanding Uncertainty
- P-Values
- Trends
- Correlation and Causation
- Rare Events
- Risk
- Infographics

This was my first time ever really seriously teaching anything to anyone.  And I'll admit, cramming 11 concepts into 20 minutes was a touch more work than I anticipated.  It DID end up being a lot of fun, however.  And I managed to learn a lot.  So thanks, AusSMC!

This video is aimed at journalists to try and give them a bit more information on how to interpret the 11 topics mentioned earlier.   It should help you.  You should learn something.  But everyone is different, so maybe it won't.  But I hope that it helps you on your journey through statistics.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Seriously!
