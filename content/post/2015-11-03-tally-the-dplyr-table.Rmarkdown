In this post I describe how to use `tally`, the `dplyr` equivalent of `table`.

`table` gives you the frequencies of something in a category. Let's use the `iris` dataset to illustrate. Let's say we want to know how many are in each species in `iris`.

```{r}

table(iris$Species)

```

So there happen to be 50 in each of the species. 

But if you want to present this in a tidy dataframe, where each column is a variable, and each row is an observation, you'd have to do some annoying reformating. But need not dispair, `dplyr` has us covered.


```{r}

library(dplyr)

iris.tally <- iris %>%
  group_by(Species) %>% 
  tally

iris.tally
```

This gives us a neat dataframe, where we get Species as a column, and the number of observations in each Species.

One of the reasons I like this is because it means I can do something like create a table using `knitr::kable` if I need to for a report.

So I could now do this:

```{r}

library(knitr)

kable(iris.tally)

```

Thanks to [this SO post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24409376/dplyr-how-can-i-write-equivalent-to-table-base-function-and-preserve-column-n) for providing me with knowledge of `tally` and providing inspiration for this post.
