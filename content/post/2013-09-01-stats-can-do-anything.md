Sometimes people are fond of saying:
<blockquote>"Well, <em>you know</em>, the thing with statistics is that you can get the statistics to say whatever you want."</blockquote>
I think that this is the equivalent of saying:
<blockquote>"...What I am saying is true because of my argument."</blockquote>
You can <em>say</em> that anything is true, but what really matters is the <strong>strength of your argument.</strong>

And statistics...

The same goes for statistics, you could perform a variety of tests to support a particular point.

However, your argument depends  on the suitability of your statistical test for what you are <strong>trying to prove or demonstrate</strong>.

Statistics are used to articulate a particular point. The author has the responsibility of ensuring they are <strong>correctly</strong> using a statistic to prove this point.

The reader also has a responsibility to evaluate their use of tools to construct and support their argument.

So yes, statistics could be used to support the argument
<blockquote>Johnny steals tim tams from Nick, as he has done this a statistically significant number of times.</blockquote>
Upon reading this, one should be very keen to investigate the ways in which the statistics were used, and ask questions like:

> What data was it? Observation? _Who_ observed it? _How_ did they observe it?

> What sort of anaysis was used? Why?

> Were any data transformations used? Why?

And so on. 

So when someone says that statistics can be used to prove anything, I like to replace this with:
<blockquote>"You can argue any point, and sometimes the people who don't know any better will nod their head quietly and whisper <em>"</em><em>statistics said it was so" "</em></blockquote>
Others will nod their heads too.

But it is your job as a good researcher / reader to ask the all important:
<blockquote>Why?</blockquote>
