What does the word _analytical_, mean?  

Wikipedia says:

> "Analytic Solution"

> - A solution to a problem that can be written in "closed form" in terms of known functions, constants, etc.

I find that such a definition relies on the reader knowing what the words 'closed form', 'known functions' and 'constants' are.

So here's my definition:

> "Analytic Solution"

> A solution where everything needed to solve a particular question is presented clearly and logically, with all assumptions defined.  

Waddaya reckon?
