This blog post is in a series about using and assessing good colours in R. 
This is part 1, which discusses colourblindness. Future parts will discuss how to create your own colour palettes and assess others. It draws from work done by [Kevin Wright in pals](), [Stefan]() and [Nathaniel Smith](), and implementations in a paper by Achim Zeil ...


Whenever I see a data visualisation, I'm always cued in to look at the colours that people use in their plots. In particular, I keep an eye out for things that are not colourblind safe, and not perceptually uniform.

In particular, I'm wary of three scales:

1. Jet
2. Rainbow
3. Terrain.colours

```{r show-jet-rainbow-terrain, fig.height = 3, fig.asp = NULL, echo = FALSE}
par(mfrow=c(3, 1), mar=rep(1, 4))
p_img(rev(pals::jet(25)), "jet")
p_img(rainbow(25), "rainbow")
p_img(terrain.colors(25), "terrain.colours")
```

Why? 

Two main reasons:

1. Colourblindness: Those with colourblindness might not be able to distinguish the colours used. See [my post on colourblindness for more on this]()
2. Perceptual uniformity: For these colourscales, a one unit change in data value does not often mean a one unit change in perceived colour. See [my post on colourblindness for more on this]()

This post covers two areas:

1. How to I assess my current colours?
2. How to I assess other colours?
3. How do I create better colours?

```{r pal-safe-red-green}
library(magrittr)
colorspace::demoplot(red_green)

red_green %>% 
  colorspace::deutan() %>% 
  colorspace::demoplot()

red_green %>% 
  colorspace::tritan() %>% 
  colorspace::demoplot()

red_green %>% 
  colorspace::protan() %>% 
  colorspace::demoplot(type = "pie")
```


# Why does this matter when using other previously mentioned colour scales?

Here's Rainbow:

```{r rainbow-pals-safe}
prismatic::check_color_blindness(rainbow(25))
pals::pal.safe(rainbow(25))
```

Jet:

```{r}
prismatic::check_color_blindness(pals::jet(25))
pals::pal.safe(pals::jet(25))
```

And Terrain Colours

```{r}
prismatic::check_color_blindness(terrain.colors(25))
pals::pal.safe(terrain.colors(25))
```

What does this mean?

Well, there are three categories of colourblindness:

- Deuteranopia:
- Protanopia:
- Tritanopia:

```{r}
terrain.colors(25) %>% 
  colorspace::deutan() %>% 
  colorspace::demoplot()

terrain.colors(25) %>% 
  colorspace::tritan() %>% 
  colorspace::demoplot()

terrain.colors(25) %>% 
  colorspace::protan() %>% 
  colorspace::demoplot()

terrain.colors(25) %>% 
  prismatic::check_color_blindness()

terrain.colors(25) %>% 
  colorspace::specplot()

scico::scico(n = 25, palette = "oleron") %>% 
  colorspace::specplot()

scico::scico(n = 10, palette = "hawaii") %>% 
  colorspace::specplot()

scico::scico(n = 10, palette = "hawaii")[c(1,5,7)] %>% 
  colorspace::specplot()

terrain.colors(25) %>% 
  colorspace::demoplot()
```


## Perceptually uniform

I also discussed this term of "perceptually uniform" - this is defined as:

> a unit step of colour produces a constant perceptual change in color

One that I found useful was at this SO thread: 

> if a color space is perceptually uniform, it means that a change of length x in any direction of the color space would be perceived by a human as the same change -- [slhck](https://stackoverflow.com/users/435093/slhck)




# So how do you test out your colours?

Let's look at a few common scenarios.

1. Evaluating an existing palette
2. Creating a new palette
3. Evaluating a plot

## Evaluating an existing palette



## Creating a new palette

Say, for example that you were tasked with creating a Red Amber Green (RAG) palette for work, because, that's what they need.

Let's assume that Red, Amber, and Green are from bad to worse

```{r}
rag <- prismatic::colour(c("red", "orange", "green"))
colorspace::specplot(rag)
colorspace::demoplot(rag)

rag %>% 
  colorspace::deutan() %>% 
  colorspace::demoplot()

rag %>% 
  colorspace::demoplot()

rag %>% 
  colorspace::protan() %>% 
  colorspace::demoplot()

rag %>% 
  colorspace::tritan() %>% 
  colorspace::demoplot()
```


## Evaluating a plot


```{r}
colorspace::simulate_cvd()
colorspace::specplot(colorspace::terrain_hcl(n = 25))

colorspace::demoplot(colorspace::terrain_hcl(n = 25))
colorspace::demoplot(terrain.colors(n = 25))

colorspace::cvd_emulator(here::here("content/post/drafts/2019-10-04-using-and-testing-different-colour-palettes/imgs/fire-sprinkler.JPG"))
```




In the past I've told people to use 

This refers to the properties of a sequence of colours

Let's briefly explore these using two packages, [`prismatic`](https://github.com/EmilHvitfeldt/prismatic), by [Emil Hvilfeldt](https://github.com/EmilHvitfeldt), and `colorspace` by ...


```{r}
library(prismatic) 
library(pals)

jet <- pals::jet(25)
jet_2 <- colorRampPalette(c("#00007F", "blue", "#007FFF", "cyan",
                     "#7FFF7F", "yellow", "#FF7F00", "red", "#7F0000"))
tc <- colour(terrain.colors(25))
tc_heat <- color(heat.colors(n = 25))
tc_rainbow <- color(rainbow(n = 25))

plot(tc)
```


```{r}
library(scico)
library(viridisLite)

tc_oleron <- color(scico(n = 20, palette = "oleron")) 
tc_bamako <- color(scico(n = 20, palette = "bamako")) 
tc_vir <- color(viridis(n = 20)) 
```



```{r}
pal.safe(tc)
```

# How do I test my colours?

So suppose you have a set of colours you want to use, how do you test them?

Put the colours into hex format, and then 

## Test the palette

The process is similar with a palette

## Testing the ggplot graphic

For a ggplot graphic, if you have a plot handy, you can use `colorblindr` to help
assess the colourblindness

# How do I test someone else's colours?

If you've got someone else's image, I know that there are ways you can simulate what colourblindness looks like, as I've seen people do this. But I'm actually not aware of how to do it myself.

# OK, so, what should I use then?

I'd recommend choosing from one of the following:

1. Viridis (only works for continuous colours (0-100))
2. Scico (which includes a terrain map)
3. ColorBrewer website

# Further reading

I initially started writing this blog post after seeing a lot of graphics that 
were good, but didn't use good colours scales. Once I started writing all this 
down, I did some more reading to bolster my understanding of colourscales. I
highly recommend reading the following to help you as well:

- [The refining plots chapter](https://socviz.co/refineplots.html#refineplots) of
the draft of [Kieran Healy's](https://kieranhealy.org/) Book, "Data Visualisation: A practical introduction"

- [This SO thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20172607/what-is-perceptually-uniform-color-space-and-how-lab-color-space-is-perceptually) also provided some interesting definitions:


- The [wikipedia article on colour difference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_difference) is also quite interesting.

Note: I started this on '2019-10-04'

But what about those with colourblindness? How do we see what they might see? We can put the colours into `pals::pal.safe` or `prismatic::check_color_blindness`:



# What makes up colour?

I think describing colour is actually quite hard. I often hear people talk about "saturation, luminance, brightness, hue", and I actually get pretty confused.

But here's a graphic reproduced from the [excellent paper on colorspace](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.06490.pdf) by  ...


* Hue means different colour
* Chroma means **how much** of that colour is used (how _saturated_ it is)
* Luminance means how **bright** that colour is.

* great post on [imageMagick](https://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/color_basics/)
