My name is Nick Tierney. I have an bachelors and honours degree in Psychological Science, and completed my PhD in Statistics (under [Kerrie Mengersen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerrie_Mengersen)) in 2018. I work as a freelance consultant, you can see my available services at my [consulting page](https://www.njtierney.com/consulting/).

Previously, I worked as a research software engineer, with [Nick Golding](https://www.telethonkids.org.au/contact-us/our-people/g/nick-golding/) on the [greta](https://greta-stats.org/) R package for statistical modelling, and implementing novel statistical methods for infectious diseases like COVID19 and malaria. Prior to this I worked with [Di Cook](https://www.dicook.org/) at Monash, where I created the [visdat](https://docs.ropensci.org/visdat/), [naniar](https://naniar.njtierney.com/), and [brolgar](https://brolgar.njtierney.com/) R packages for exploratory data analysis. I really believe in the power of free and open source software, you can see my other software on my [software page](http://njtierney.com/software).

I love the [R programming language](https://www.r-project.org/) and how it has transformed my world. I am a proud member of the [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/) community, a collective that works to make science open using R. I organised the rOpenSci [2016](https://auunconf.ropensci.org/), [2017](https://ozunconf17.ropensci.org/), and [2018](https://ozunconf18.ropensci.org/) ozunconf events.

I am a keen outdoors person, and hiked the Pacific Crest Trail in 2023, a 5 month hike from Mexico to Canada. It's an experience that is hard to put into words, but I wrote about it, and shared photos, at [njt.micro.blog](https://njt.micro.blog/).

I am always up for questions about anything to do with R and stats. I was really fortunate to have some really kind people show me the ways of R and statistics, and I want to help people in the same way. This website exists so I can write about what I do and engage in dialogue with statisticians, programmers, and whoever else is interested.
