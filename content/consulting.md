Ready to transform your complex data challenges into actionable insights? As a PhD statistician with 12+ years in academia (2013-2025) and a Bachelors + Honours in Psychological Science, I bring a unique combination of technical expertise, and communication skills to your projects.

# Limited Consulting Opportunities Available

I'm currently accepting select clients for new projects. My tailored approach includes:

- **Discovery**: Complimentary call to understand your specific needs
- **Customised proposal**: Clear deliverables, timeline, and pricing structure
- **Flexible engagement**: From one-time consultations to ongoing partnerships

# Services I Offer

## Data Solutions

- **Data Analytics & Visualisation**: Implementing techniques I've refined through developing the widely-used [visdat](https://github.com/ropensci/visdat) and [naniar](https://github.com/njtierney/naniar) packages (with 2M+ downloads), which help make data exploration intuitive and revealing.

- **Statistical Modelling**: Applying approaches developed during my PhD, and refined while maintaining the [greta](https://github.com/greta-dev/greta) package for statistical modelling at The Kids Research Institute Australia.

- **Missing Data Analysis**: Leveraging methodologies I pioneered in the [naniar](https://github.com/njtierney/naniar) package to uncover insights hidden in incomplete datasets. The [accompanying paper](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v105i07) to this work has been cited over 200 times since 2023.

## Technical Development

- **R Package Development**: Creating robust, user-friendly statistical tools following practices that have led to multiple successful rOpenSci-reviewed packages. I have been teaching how to develop R packages since 2016, and recently delivered a course, ["R package essentials"](https://rpkgess.njtierney.com/) on this topic.

- **Research Software Engineering**: Combining my intimate understanding of research with my programming skills, I can translate methods into software (see for example, [conmat](https://github.com/idem-lab/conmat) for use in infectious disease modelling), and develop reproducible workflows, (see [geotarget](https://github.com/njtierney/geotarget) package for geospatial pipelines, which I developed alongside collaborators [Eric Scott](https://ericrscott.com/), and [Andrew Gene Brown](https://humus.rocks/)).

- **Code Review & Optimisation**: Applying principles refined through years of collaborative development and maintenance of open-source statistical software. I can help make your code easier to read and maintain, and improve how quickly your code runs.

## Knowledge Transfer

- **Teaching**: Building on experience as a university lecturer in data analysis and business analytics at Monash University. I can deliver courses on the Tidyverse, Quarto, R package development, data visualisation, data analytics, exploratory data analysis, general R programming skills, using git and github, and developing reproducible pipelines using targets.

- **Mentoring**: I can meet with you or a small group on a regular basis to develop customised material and code review, so you can improve your data analytic skills.

# My Approach

1. **Understand**: Applying active listening techniques from my counselling training to fully grasp your challenges
2. **Analyse**: Examining your data and processes to identify opportunities for improvement
3. **Develop**: Creating tailored solutions using state of the art methods
4. **Implement**: Providing clear documentation and knowledge transfer
5. **Refine**: Iteratively improving solutions based on feedback and results

# Real-World Impact

My work extends beyond academia into practical applications:

- Supporting infectious disease modelling during my time with Prof. Nick Golding's team (2021-2025)
  - An author of the Doherty Institute Modelling Report to advise on the National Plan to transition Australia's National COVID Response.
- Developing optimisation solutions with [maxcovr](https://github.com/njtierney/maxcovr) for resource allocation problems. 
  - In my PhD I developed methods to [identify new locations for Automatic External Defibrillator (AEDs) in Switzerland](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0300957218300650).

# About Dr. Nick Tierney

Beyond my technical work, I completed the 4,270km Pacific Crest Trail hike in 2023, demonstrating the same persistence and problem-solving approach I bring to complex data challenges. This experience reinforced my belief that careful planning, adaptability, and determination are key to successfully navigating both wilderness trails and data landscapes. You can read more about me at [bio](bio.md).

# Let's Solve Your Data Challenges

I'm currently accepting projects starting May 2025. Contact me at nicholas `<dot>` tierney `{at}` `[gmail]` `(dot)` com to discuss how my expertise can advance your objectives. Initial consultations are complimentary and without obligation.
