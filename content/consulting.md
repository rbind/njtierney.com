**Struggling with your data?** Too big? Too messy? Missing? **I can help with that.**

Need your analyses to run faster? Have a tangled codebase that needs organising into a pipeline or R package? **That's exactly what I love solving.** 

Not even sure where to begin with your data or what questions to ask? Want to build your team's analytical skills? **I'll explore your data with you and provide the teaching and mentoring you need.**

I have a unique combination of technical expertise and communication skills: a Bachelors + Honours in Psychological Science, and a PhD in statistics, with 12+ years in academia (2013-2025).

# Work with me!

I'm **currently accepting** select clients for new projects. My approach is tailored to your needs, and generally looks like the following:

- **Discovery**: Complimentary call to understand your specific needs
- **Customised proposal**: Clear deliverables, timeline, and pricing structure
- **Flexible engagement**: From one-time consultations to ongoing partnerships

# Services I Offer

## Data Solutions

- **Data Analytics & Visualisation**: Implementing techniques I've refined through developing the widely-used [visdat](https://github.com/ropensci/visdat) and [naniar](https://github.com/njtierney/naniar) packages (with 2M+ downloads), which help make data exploration intuitive and revealing.

- **Statistical Modelling**: Applying approaches developed during my PhD, and refined during my postdoc at Monash, and while maintaining the [greta](https://github.com/greta-dev/greta) package for statistical modelling at [The Kids Research Institute Australia](https://www.thekids.org.au/).

- **Missing Data Analysis**: Leveraging methodologies I pioneered with [Di Cook](https://www.dicook.org/) in the [naniar](https://github.com/njtierney/naniar) package to uncover insights hidden in incomplete datasets. Our [accompanying paper](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v105i07) to this work has been cited over 200 times since 2023.

## Technical Development

- **R Package Development**: Creating user-centred tools following practices that have led to multiple successful rOpenSci-reviewed packages. I have been teaching how to develop R packages since 2016 (see my most recent course ["R package essentials"](https://rpkgess.njtierney.com/))

- **Research Software Engineering**: Combining my intimate understanding of research with my programming skills, I can translate methods into software (see for example, [conmat](https://github.com/idem-lab/conmat) for use in infectious disease modelling), and develop reproducible workflows, (see [geotarget](https://github.com/njtierney/geotarget) package for geospatial pipelines, which I developed alongside collaborators [Eric Scott](https://ericrscott.com/), and [Andrew Gene Brown](https://humus.rocks/)).

- **Code Review & Optimisation**: Applying principles refined through years of collaborative development and maintenance of open-source statistical software. I can help make your code easier to read and maintain, and make your code run faster.

## Training

- **Teaching**: Building on my experience as a university lecturer in data analysis and business analytics at Monash University. I can deliver courses on the Tidyverse, [Quarto](https://qmd4sci.njtierney.com/), [R package development](https://rpkgess.njtierney.com/), data visualisation, data analytics, exploratory data analysis, general R programming skills, using git and github, and [developing reproducible pipelines using targets](https://github.com/njtierney/gentle-intro-targets).

- **Mentoring**: I can meet with you or a small group on a regular basis to develop customised material and code review, so you can improve your data analytic skills. I've previously run code review in the [infectious disease ecology and modelling team](https://www.thekids.org.au/our-research/brain-and-behaviour/child-health-analytics-research-program/infectious-disease-ecology-and-modelling/), [live streamed my review of R packages](https://www.youtube.com/@NicholasTierney/streams), and also led [rOpenSci coworking sessions](https://ropensci.org/coworking/).

# Let's Solve Your Data Challenges
