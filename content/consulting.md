**Struggling with your data?** Too big? Too messy? Missing? **I can help with that.**

Need your analyses to run faster? Have a tangled codebase that needs organising into a pipeline or R package? **That's exactly what I love solving.** 

Not even sure where to begin with your data? Or what questions to ask? Want to build your team's analytical skills? **I'll explore your data with you and provide the teaching and mentoring you need.**

I have a unique combination of technical expertise and communication skills: a Bachelors + Honours in Psychological Science, and a PhD in statistics, with 12+ years in academia (2013-2025).

# Work with me!

I'm **currently accepting** select clients for new projects. My approach is tailored to your needs, and generally looks like the following:

- **Discovery**: Complimentary call to understand your specific needs
- **Customised proposal**: Clear deliverables, timeline, and pricing structure
- **Flexible engagement**: From one-time consultations to ongoing partnerships

# Services I Offer

## Data Solutions

- **Data Analytics & Visualisation**: I can teach you how to create beautiful data visualisations using packages like [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/). More than just the tools, I can teach you how to communicate your message, and find the story in your data. I can also create R packages for data visualisation, data analytics and exploratory data analysis. I have a track record of widely used data visualisation packages - my packages [visdat](https://github.com/ropensci/visdat) and [naniar](https://github.com/njtierney/naniar) have been downloaded over 2 million times.

- **Statistical Modelling**: Applying approaches developed during my PhD, and refined during my postdoc at Monash, and while maintaining the [greta](https://github.com/greta-dev/greta) package for statistical modelling at [The Kids Research Institute Australia](https://www.thekids.org.au/).

- **Missing Data Analysis**: Together with [Di Cook](https://www.dicook.org/), we wrote the [naniar](https://github.com/njtierney/naniar) package to uncover insights hidden in incomplete datasets. Our [accompanying paper](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v105i07) has been cited over 200 times since 2023. You can also see my book that I wrote with [Allison Horst](https://allisonhorst.com/), ["The Missing Book"](https://tmb.njtierney.com/), which provides more detail and exercises for missing data.

## Technical Development

- **R Package Development**: Create user-centred tools following [rOpenSci Standards](https://ropensci.org/software-review/). I have been teaching how to develop R packages since 2016. See my course, ["R package essentials"](https://rpkgess.njtierney.com/).

- **Research Software Engineering**: I combine my understanding of research  with programming skills to translate methods into software. For example, [conmat](https://github.com/idem-lab/conmat) for use in infectious disease modelling, and [geotargets](https://github.com/njtierney/geotargets) for geospatial pipelines. Notably, `geotargets` was only made possible by collaborators [Eric Scott](https://ericrscott.com/), and [Andrew Gene Brown](https://humus.rocks/).

- **Code Review & Optimisation**: Applying principles refined through years of collaborative development and maintenance of free and open-source statistical software. I can help make your code faster to run, and easier to read and maintain.

## Training

- **Teaching**: Building on my experience as a university lecturer in data analysis and business analytics at Monash University. I can deliver courses on the Tidyverse, [Quarto](https://qmd4sci.njtierney.com/), [R package development](https://rpkgess.njtierney.com/), data visualisation, data analytics, exploratory data analysis, general R programming skills, using git and github, and [developing reproducible pipelines using targets](https://github.com/njtierney/gentle-intro-targets).

- **Mentoring**: I can meet with you or a small group on a regular basis to develop customised material and code review, so you can improve your data analytic skills. I've previously run code review in the [infectious disease ecology and modelling team](https://www.thekids.org.au/our-research/brain-and-behaviour/child-health-analytics-research-program/infectious-disease-ecology-and-modelling/), [live streamed my review of R packages](https://www.youtube.com/@NicholasTierney/streams), and also led [rOpenSci coworking sessions](https://ropensci.org/coworking/).
