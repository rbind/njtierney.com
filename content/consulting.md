Do you have problems with your data? Too big? Can't read it in? Too messy? Too much missing? I can help with that.

Maybe you need your data analysis to run faster, you have a large code base that is hard to understand, or you need to turn some existing code into a pipeline, or an R package? I'd love nothing more than to help.

Or maybe you just don't even know where to start with your data? You're not sure what questions to ask, or what analysis to run? Or you want to build capacity in your team. I can explore the data, and help teach you the skills and provide mentoring.

I think the reason I can help with all these problems are that I have a unique combination of technical expertise and communication skills. I have a PhD in statistics, with 12+ years in academia (2013-2025) and a Bachelors + Honours in Psychological Science.

# Limited Consulting Opportunities Available

I'm currently accepting select clients for new projects. My approach is tailored to your needs, and generally looks like the following:

- **Discovery**: Complimentary call to understand your specific needs
- **Customised proposal**: Clear deliverables, timeline, and pricing structure
- **Flexible engagement**: From one-time consultations to ongoing partnerships

# Services I Offer

## Data Solutions

- **Data Analytics & Visualisation**: Implementing techniques I've refined through developing the widely-used [visdat](https://github.com/ropensci/visdat) and [naniar](https://github.com/njtierney/naniar) packages (with 2M+ downloads), which help make data exploration intuitive and revealing.

- **Statistical Modelling**: Applying approaches developed during my PhD, and refined during my postdoc at Monash, and while maintaining the [greta](https://github.com/greta-dev/greta) package for statistical modelling at [The Kids Research Institute Australia](https://www.thekids.org.au/).

- **Missing Data Analysis**: Leveraging methodologies I pioneered with [Di Cook](https://www.dicook.org/) in the [naniar](https://github.com/njtierney/naniar) package to uncover insights hidden in incomplete datasets. Our [accompanying paper](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v105i07) to this work has been cited over 200 times since 2023.

## Technical Development

- **R Package Development**: Creating user-centred tools following practices that have led to multiple successful rOpenSci-reviewed packages. I have been teaching how to develop R packages since 2016 (see my most recent course ["R package essentials"](https://rpkgess.njtierney.com/))

- **Research Software Engineering**: Combining my intimate understanding of research with my programming skills, I can translate methods into software (see for example, [conmat](https://github.com/idem-lab/conmat) for use in infectious disease modelling), and develop reproducible workflows, (see [geotarget](https://github.com/njtierney/geotarget) package for geospatial pipelines, which I developed alongside collaborators [Eric Scott](https://ericrscott.com/), and [Andrew Gene Brown](https://humus.rocks/)).

- **Code Review & Optimisation**: Applying principles refined through years of collaborative development and maintenance of open-source statistical software. I can help make your code easier to read and maintain, and make your code run faster.

## Knowledge Transfer

- **Teaching**: Building on my experience as a university lecturer in data analysis and business analytics at Monash University. I can deliver courses on the Tidyverse, Quarto, R package development, data visualisation, data analytics, exploratory data analysis, general R programming skills, using git and github, and developing reproducible pipelines using targets.

- **Mentoring**: I can meet with you or a small group on a regular basis to develop customised material and code review, so you can improve your data analytic skills.

# My Approach

1. **Understand**: Applying active listening techniques from my counselling training to fully grasp your challenges
2. **Analyse**: Examining your data and workflow to identify opportunities for improvement
3. **Develop**: Creating bespoke solutions using state-of-the-art methods
4. **Implement**: Providing clear documentation to facilitate knowledge transfer
5. **Refine**: Iteratively improve solutions based on feedback and results

# Real-World Impact

My work extends beyond academia into practical applications:

- Supporting infectious disease modelling during my time with [Prof. Nick Golding's](https://www.thekids.org.au/contact-us/our-people/g/nick-golding/) [IDEM team](https://www.thekids.org.au/our-research/brain-and-behaviour/child-health-analytics-research-program/infectious-disease-ecology-and-modelling/) (2021-2025)
  - An author of the [Doherty Institute Modelling Report](https://www.doherty.edu.au/our-work/institute-themes/viral-infectious-diseases/covid-19/covid-19-modelling/modelling) to advise on the National Plan to transition Australia's National COVID Response.
- Developing optimisation solutions with [maxcovr](https://github.com/njtierney/maxcovr) for resource allocation problems. 
  - In my PhD I developed methods to [identify new locations for Automatic External Defibrillator (AEDs) in Switzerland](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0300957218300650).

# About Dr. Nick Tierney

Beyond my technical work, I really enjoy getting outside. I completed the 4,270km Pacific Crest Trail hike in 2023, demonstrating the same persistence and problem-solving approach I bring to complex data analysis. This experience reinforced my belief that careful planning, adaptability, and determination are key to successfully navigating both wilderness trails, and data landscapes. You can read more about me at [bio](https://www.njtierney.com/bio/).
