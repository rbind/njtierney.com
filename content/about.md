My name is Nick Tierney. I have an bachelors and honours degree in Psychological Science, and completed my PhD in Statistics (under [Kerrie Mengersen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerrie_Mengersen)) in 2018. I currently work as a research software engineer, with [Nick Golding](https://www.telethonkids.org.au/contact-us/our-people/g/nick-golding/) on the [greta](https://greta-stats.org/) R package for statistical modelling, and implementing novel statistical methods for infectious diseases like COVID19 and malaria.

I am about to start a new foray into consulting. From May 2025, I will be taking clients for data analytics, modelling, code review, research software engineering, R package development, targets pipelines, teaching, mentoring and R coaching.

I've had a great journey in academia working with brilliant people, and while it's bittersweet (and a bit scary!), I'm excited for this next step. I'll still be maintaining [greta](https://greta-stats.org/), and am hoping to be even more involved with the R community.

If you've got a project, need help with R, or want to chat about what I might be able to help with, I'd love to connect! 

I am a strong advocate for free and open source software, and have written several R packages to improve data analysis. These can be seen on my [software page](http://njtierney.com/software).

I love the [R programming language](https://www.r-project.org/) and how it has transformed my world. I am a proud member of the [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/) community, a collective that works to make science open using R. I organised the rOpenSci [2016](https://auunconf.ropensci.org/), [2017](https://ozunconf17.ropensci.org/), and [2018](https://ozunconf18.ropensci.org/) ozunconf events.

I am a keen outdoors person, and hiked the Pacific Crest Trail in 2023, a 5 month hike from Mexico to Canada. It's an experience that is hard to put into words, but I wrote about it, and shared photos, at [njt.micro.blog](https://njt.micro.blog/).

I am always up for questions about anything to do with R and stats. I was really fortunate to have some really kind people show me the ways of R and statistics, and I want to help people in the same way. This website exists so I can write about what I do and engage in dialogue with statisticians, programmers, and whoever else is interested.
