<!-- ### Currently

I'm a PhD candidate in my final year of a 4 year program through the [Industry Doctoral Training Centre (IDTC)](https://www.atn.edu.au/industry/IDTC/) at the [Queensland University of Technology](www.qut.edu.au), due to finish in May 2017. My PhD project is broken into two parts: 1. Statistical analysis of Occupational Health Surveillance data; 2. Mathematical and Statistical modelling of Cardiac Arrests and AED locations in Switzerland. -->

## Education

### Postgraduate

`Award` __APA ($24,500 Annually for 4 years)__ ; __IDTC Top Up ($10,000 Annually for 4 years)__ .

`Research` Research covers model-based exploration methods of missing data, Bayesian longitudinal modelling of individual and group health in a mining site, optimal placement of Automatic Electronic Defibrillators (AEDs), modelling geospatial cardiac risk, and the production of R packages to facilitate research impact.

### Undergraduate

`2008-12` __B. PsychSc (Honours)__, University of Queensland. Supervisor: Philip Grove.

`Research` Conducted psychophysical research on whether sharpness of a leading edge in a 3D environment improves under specific scenarios of monocular occlusion in the thesis: _"How Sharp is Sharp?: The Effect of Monocular Texture on Enhancing Sharpness."_ __Awarded first class honours__.

`2010` __Exchange semester__, McGill University. Studied History of Personality Theory, Abnormal Psychology, Psychology of Interpersonal Relationships, Ethics, and Intermediate French.
